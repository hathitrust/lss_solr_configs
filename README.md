* test files to overwrite production files once testing and changes are finalized
  * **test_schema_tfidf.xml**
     references test_1000common.txt file and corrects two errors in schmema_tfidf.xml
  * **test_1000common.txt**
    new commongrams file per https://tools.lib.umich.edu/jira/browse/HT-2145
## What is the problem we are trying to solve

These files customize Solr for HT full-text search for Solr 6. Our very large indexes require significant changes to Solr defaults in order to work.  We also have custom indexing to deal with multiple languages, and very large documents.

## Explanation of files

The two critical files for configuring Solr are solrconfig.xml and schema.xml
We use two different versions of schema.xml to enable two different relevance ranking algorithms

1. **schema_tfidf.xml** Enables the Solr 4 default tf-idf algorithm.
   Currently this schema is use in the core-Nx cores i.e. core-1x and is named **schema6_tfidf_wiDVmondo.xml** in production
2. **schema_BM25.xml** Enables the BM25 algorithm with special settings for the OCR field.
   Currently this schema is used in the core-Ny cores i.e. core-1y and is named **schema6_BM25_wiDVmondo.xml** in production

All instances use the same **solrconfig.xml** file except for the lss-reindexing Solrs.  (See re-indexing configuration https://tools.lib.umich.edu/confluence/display/HAT/Solr+configuration+for+re-indexing?src=contextnavpagetreemode )


**1000common.txt** is the list of common words used during indexing to create commongrams.  See https://www.hathitrust.org/blogs/large-scale-search/slow-queries-and-common-words-part-2 for background. See https://tools.lib.umich.edu/confluence/display/HAT/Tuning+CommonGrams+and+the+cache-warming+queries for information on updating the list of words in this file. This file name is specfied in the schema.xml files in these two lines:
```
<filter class="solr.CommonGramsFilterFactory" words="1000common.txt" />
<filter class="solr.CommonGramsQueryFilterFactory" words="1000common.txt" />
```

### Testing
### Deployment to Production
### Production Indexing
### Production Serving


## Migrating to later versions of Solr/Lucene
This may need a separate document on confluence.  Think about it...
